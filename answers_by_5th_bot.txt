1: <|BOS|>Would you still eat meat if, YOU had to KILL the animal for it, why or why not? <|SEP|> I'd be fine with that. But would there have been a way in which we could kill all of them and get rid of every single one after eating


2: <|BOS|>Would you still eat meat if, YOU had to KILL the animal for it, why or why not? <|SEP|> No. If I could get away with murder i would kill my dog and then probably be a vegetarian


3: <|BOS|>Would you still eat meat if, YOU had to KILL the animal for it, why or why not? <|SEP|> Yes. I'd kill whoever made me want that steak and then just leave my body in a pile of dead animals when they get home


4: <|BOS|>Would you still eat meat if, YOU had to KILL the animal for it, why or why not? <|SEP|> I'd kill a cow and then cut off all of its bones.

5: <|BOS|>What are your thoughts on states canceling unemployment because they see it as people being lazy and not wanting to work? <|SEP|> I think the best way is for a state that doesn't have good jobs. It's more like "We'll keep this job until we retire."

Ask me anything!:Parents of Reddit, how do you control your children’s exposure to religion?
how many answers do you want?7
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
1: <|BOS|>Parents of Reddit, how do you control your children’s exposure to religion? <|SEP|> I have two kids who are atheists. They don t talk much and they will be quiet about it all the time when talking or being with other people s parents because that is their job as a parent. My daughter has been told she isn't allowed outside until after school if her mom gets home from work/school (I think). But this one day my husband got in his car and he was like oh shit! He didn t even know what drove him out anymore so now we just sit around doing nothing while playing video games on our phones for hours watching movies etc


2: <|BOS|>Parents of Reddit, how do you control your children’s exposure to religion? <|SEP|> I'm not religious but my mom does it and she's a very Christian one. She'll always be the only person that says "I have faith in God" when someone else doesn't believe them


3: <|BOS|>Parents of Reddit, how do you control your children’s exposure to religion? <|SEP|> My parents are catholic and they have a very strong belief in god. They believe that the Earth is round or flat like stars but also not black holes (that s where my sister lives). I m sure this will be buried under some crazy religious beliefs though


4: <|BOS|>Parents of Reddit, how do you control your children’s exposure to religion? <|SEP|> My daughter is an Atheist. She's had her own beliefs for many years and she'll have the same ones over time...I don't care if they're not Christian or atheist but it will always be something I can get behind


5: <|BOS|>Parents of Reddit, how do you control your children’s exposure to religion? <|SEP|> I have a little bit less than 10 years old. But if we're going through something similar and the kids are being bullied or even worse for not believing in God...we'll just let them know they aren't allowed anywhere near our faith because it's an unspoken rule that no one should be afraid from having any other person around who isn't their parents (they also don t really care about what is happening).

2: <|BOS|>Americans Of Reddit, how old are you? and how many times have you been called for jury duty? <|SEP|> I'm 19. My wife is 16 (she's 22) so it makes sense that she'd be in court as a witness if not her lawyer or my own attorney...


3: <|BOS|>Americans Of Reddit, how old are you? and how many times have you been called for jury duty? <|SEP|> I'm 32.


4: <|BOS|>Americans Of Reddit, how old are you? and how many times have you been called for jury duty? <|SEP|> I was a witness to an 18 year-old who tried repeatedly on multiple occasions that his mom had him beat up by her husband. He said he couldn't remember which one she got the most in pain from (because of some kind kid being beaten up).


5: <|BOS|>Americans Of Reddit, how old are you? and how many times have you been called for jury duty? <|SEP|> I'm 32. My family is 23 years older than me (I was a teenager when we got together). They all live in different states now so my mom still lives here because she has to pay tuition for her own college education

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
1: <|BOS|>People of Reddit, what is the funniest date you've had? <|SEP|> Went to a party and I'm sitting at my table with an older gentleman who was talking about his life. He says he's having trouble making friends so we all go out for drinks before going back into town on our first day there...I think it might be something like this: "Hey man have some beers tonight."


2: <|BOS|>People of Reddit, what is the funniest date you've had? <|SEP|> My wife and I went to a restaurant. The waitress asked if we could go on our first dates at my place because she knew that was going in for us both.


3: <|BOS|>People of Reddit, what is the funniest date you've had? <|SEP|> Went to a wedding in Paris. The groom and I went out for dinner together that evening at her place (in France) which was just a few blocks away from where we were going but she didn't know who did it as there are no buildings nearby so they all sat on one corner waiting. After some conversation with my friend about how much time passed by etc...she tells me "I'm sorry sir" then proceeds to say something along those lines..and after 5 minutes or whatever i realized exactly why this happened lol


4: <|BOS|>People of Reddit, what is the funniest date you've had? <|SEP|> I was in a restaurant with my friends and this girl came up to us. She looked at me like she wanted to show off her tits so we were kind enough not to talk about it but still...


5: <|BOS|>People of Reddit, what is the funniest date you've had? <|SEP|> I was at a club and this guy came up to me in front. He asked if he could join us for drinks before we went out on dates with other guys from our area that were there too! And then proceeded all over again after being groped by his gf/wife (she didn't know). We ended it pretty good but when she brought her friend back home one night she said "I'm sorry... Did your friends get pregnant?" She told him no because they are married now so not many people have any kids or don t like them.. So i left lol

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
1: <|BOS|>What new jobs exist now that didn't exist before and that people don't know about? <|SEP|> I work in the kitchen, but it's not like we're a place to hide your food. It goes everywhere you go for days or weeks at a time so if something gets caught on camera/crack of paper they can take photos (like some kind with them) from around where someone is looking through their cameras then leave. The other day my coworker was trying his best while sitting beside him when he saw an older woman running towards her husband holding another lady by her hair... And she turned into herself....


2: <|BOS|>What new jobs exist now that didn't exist before and that people don't know about? <|SEP|> I have a dream job where you're supposed to do the work for free, but when your boss asks "what are we doing?", or if it's something like running an office.


3: <|BOS|>What new jobs exist now that didn't exist before and that people don't know about? <|SEP|> I'm an electrician.


4: <|BOS|>What new jobs exist now that didn't exist before and that people don't know about? <|SEP|> I'm a chef at an Asian restaurant in the US. We have this one guy who goes to go around all over everything, he's always there for us when we need him most of our time so his only concern is finding something good (or just plain food) or making it more difficult than necessary

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
1: <|BOS|>When did you get screwed over by different time zones? <|SEP|> When I was in college, my buddy would drive to the back of a car and hit me with his hand. He said it hurt so bad that he couldn't move or even see what happened until we got there


2: <|BOS|>When did you get screwed over by different time zones? <|SEP|> I was in a bar with my girlfriend and one of the guys from that club came up to us, said "I'm not going out here. You are going home."


3: <|BOS|>When did you get screwed over by different time zones? <|SEP|> When I was younger. In middle school, there were a lot of kids who would be on the bus or ride their bikes to and from work at night so they could go home late if it wasn't an evening (we had no idea how long we'd have been in that area). So one day my dad's friends called me up for lunch because he thought something weird happened while driving around town with his bike lights off all night...it didn t happen until later when our teacher told us this.


4: <|BOS|>When did you get screwed over by different time zones? <|SEP|> I was driving to work and the car behind me went a little too far. The driver didn't realize what they were doing so he pulled up next door for my car in front of them (the guy who drove it) but then said "what's going on?" And left his seatbelt, which is right above mine!


5: <|BOS|>When did you get screwed over by different time zones? <|SEP|> When I was 15, my friend and his dad were going to the beach in a couple of days. The day before they got there we went out for dinner with some friends from our neighborhood who didn't have their phones on because it's too late so everyone else had cellphones left hanging around us while we sat down at home watching movies or something...

2: <|BOS|>Dear Redditors, what's something you'd tell/teach/... your younger self, if you could? <|SEP|> Don't be a jerk. I know it sounds cliche but that would just mean i don t have to do anything and not talk about my issues or problems in any way


3: <|BOS|>Dear Redditors, what's something you'd tell/teach/... your younger self, if you could? <|SEP|> That the world is not fair to anyone. You are a human being and that we should all be respected by others so no one can judge us for our faults or how much they think of themselves as their own person

4: <|BOS|>What's your opinion on taxes? <|SEP|> I would say it s a good idea.


5: <|BOS|>What's your opinion on taxes? <|SEP|> The best way to tax it is you are paying for everything in the world. If we all go out of our ways, then there will be a time when no one wants anyone else living around them so they can buy their own shit
